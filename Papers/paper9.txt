abstract
this study investigates a possible way to analyze chat data from
collaborative learning environments using epistemic network
analysis and topic modeling. a 300-topic general topic model
built from tasa (touchstone applied science associates) corpus was used in this study. 300 topic scores for each of the 15,670
utterances in our chat data were computed. seven relevant topics
were selected based on the total document scores. while the aggregated topic scores had some power in predicting students’
learning, using epistemic network analysis enables assessing the
data from a different angle. the results showed that the topic
score based epistemic networks between low gain students and
high gain students were significantly different (𝑡 = 2.00). overall,
the results suggest these two analytical approaches provide complementary information and afford new insights into the processes
related to successful collaborative interactions.

1. introduction
collaborative learning is a special form of learning and interaction
that affords opportunities for groups of students to combine cognitive resources and synchronously or asynchronously participate in
tasks to accomplish shared learning goals [15; 20]. collaborative
learning groups can range from a pair of learners (called a dyad),
to small groups (3-5 learners), to classroom learning (25-35 learners), and more recently large-scale online learning environments
with hundreds or even thousands of students [5; 22]. the collaborative process provides learners with a more efficient learning
experience and improves learners’ collaborative learning skills,
which are critical competencies for students [14]. members in a
team are different in many ways. they have their own experience,
knowledge, skills, and approaches to learning. a student in a col-

laborative learning environment can take other students’ views
and ideas about the information provided in the learning material.
the ideas coming out of the team can then be integrated as a
deeper understanding of the material, or a better solution to a
problem.
traditional collaborative learning occurred in the form of face to
face group discussion or problem solving. as the internet and
learning technologies develop, online collaborative learning environments come out and are playing more and more important
roles. for example, moocs (massive open online courses) have
drawn massive number of learners. learners in moocs are connected by the internet and can easily interact with each other using
various types of tools, such as forums, blogs and social networks
[23]. these digitized environments make it possible to track the
learning processes in collaborative learning environments in
greater detail.
communication is one of the main factors that differentiates collaborative learning from individual learning [4; 6; 9]. as such,
chats from collaborative learning environments provide rich data
that contains information about the dynamics in a learning process. understanding massive chat data from collaborative learning
environments is interesting and challenging. many tools have
been invented and used in chat data analysis, such as liwc (linguistic inquiry and word count) [12], coh-metrix [10], and topic
modeling, just to name a few. epistemic network analysis (ena)
has been playing a unique role in analyzing chat data from epistemic games [18]. ena is rooted in a specific theory of learning:
the epistemic frame theory, in which the collection of skill,
knowledge, identity, value and epistemology (skive) forms an
epistemic frame. a critical theoretical assumption of ena is that
the connections between the elements of epistemic frames are
critical for learning, not their presence in isolation. the online
ena toolkit allows users to analyze chat data by comparing the
connections within the epistemic networks derived from chats.
ena visualization displays the clustering of learners and groups
and the network connections of individual learners and groups.
ena requires coded data which has traditionally relied on hand
coded data sets or classifiers that rely on regular expression mapping. combining topic modeling with ena will provide a new
mode of preparing data sets for analysis using ena.
in this study, we used a combination of topic modeling and ena
to analyze chat data to see if we could detect differences between
the connections made by students with high learning gains versus
students with low learning gains. incorporating topic modeling

with ena will make the analytic tool more fully automated and of
greater use to the research community.

2. related work
chats have two obvious features. first, they appear in the form of
text. therefore, any text analysis tool may have a role in chat
analysis. second, chats come from individuals’ interaction, which
reflects social dynamics between participants. therefore, a combination of text analysis and social network analysis should be
helpful in understanding underlying chat dynamics. for instance,
tuulos et al. [21] combined topic modeling with social network
analysis in chat data analysis. they found that topic modeling can
help identify the receiver of chats (the person who a chat is given
to).
in a similar effort, scholand et al. [16] combined liwc and social
network analysis to form a method called “social language network analysis” (slna). the social networks were formed by
counting the number of times chat occurred between any two
participants. based on the counts, participants were clustered into
a tree structure, representing the level of subgroups the participants belong to. liwc was then used to get the text features of
chats. it was found that, some liwc features were significantly
different between in group conversations and out of group conversations.
researchers have also recently explored the advantages of combining sna (social network analysis) with deeper level computational linguistic tools, like coh-metrix. coh-metrix computes
over 100 text features. the five most important coh-metrix features are: narrativity, syntax simplicity, word concreteness, referential cohesion and deep cohesion. dowell and colleagues [8]
explored the extent to which characteristics of discourse diagnostically reveals learners’ performance and social position in
moocs. they found that learners who performed significantly
better engaged in more expository style discourse, with surface
and deep level cohesive integration, abstract language, and simple
syntactic structures. however, linguistic profiles of the centrally
positioned learners differed from the high performers. learners
with a more significant and central position in their social network
engaged using a more narrative style discourse with less overlap
between words and ideas, simpler syntactic structures and abstract
words. an increasing methodological contribution of this work
highlights how automated linguistic analysis of student interactions can complement social network analysis (sna) techniques
by adding rich contextual information to the structural patterns of
learner interactions.

final sample. within the population, 50.5% of the sample identified as caucasian, 22.2% as hispanic/latino, 15.4% as asian
american, 4.4% as african american, and less than 1% identified
as either native american or pacific islander.
course details and procedure. students were told that they
would be participating in an assignment that involved a collaborative discussion on personality disorders and taking quizzes. students were told that their assignment was to log into an online
educational platform specific to the university at a specified time,
where they would take quizzes and interact via web chat with one
to four random group members. students were also instructed
that, prior to logging onto the educational platform, they would
have to read material on personality disorders. after logging into
the system, students took a 10 item, multiple choice pretest quiz.
this quiz asked students to apply their knowledge of personality
disorders to various scenarios and to draw conclusions based on
the nature of the disorders. the following is an example of the
types of quiz questions students were exposed to:





jacob was diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. why might dr. simon think this was the wrong
diagnosis?
dr. level has measured and described his 10 mice of
varying ages in terms of their length (cm) and weight
(g). how might he describe them on these characteristics using a dimensional approach?
danielle checks her facebook page every hour. does
danielle have narcissistic personality disorder?

after completing the quiz, they were randomly assigned to other
students who were waiting to engage in the chatroom portion of
the task. when there were at least 2 students and no more than 5
students (m = 4.59), individuals were directed to an instant messaging platform that was built into the educational platform. the
group chat began as soon as someone typed the first message and
lasted for 20 minutes. the chat window closed automatically after
20 minutes, at which time students took a second 10 multiplechoice question quiz. each student contributed 154.0 words on
average (sd = 104.9) in 19.5 sentences (sd = 12.5). as a group,
discussions were about 714.8 words long (sd = 235.7) and 90.6
sentences long (sd = 33.5).

in another study, dowell et al. [7] showed that students’ linguistic
characteristics, namely higher degrees of narrativity and deep
cohesion, are predictive of their learning. that is, students engaged in deep cohesive interactions performed better.

art

ok cool, everyone's here. sooo first question

art

ok so the certain characteristics to be considered to
have a personality disorder?

in the present research, we explore collaborative interaction chat
data using the combination of topic modeling and epistemic network analysis. while previous studies focused on the relationship
between language features and social network connections, our
study focuses on prediction learning performance by semantic
network connections students make in chats.

shaffer

alright sooo first question: based on these criteria describe several reasons why a psychologist might not
label someone with grandiose thoughts as having narcissistic personality disorder?

shaffer

hahaha never mind

shaffer

that was the second question.

3. methods

art

lol its all good

shaffer

okay so certain characteristics: doesn't it have to be like
a stable thing?

carl

i think the main thing about having a disorder is that its
disruptive socially and/or makes the person a danger to
himself or others

participants. participants were enrolled in an introductory-level
psychology course taught in the fall semester of 2011 at a large
university in the usa. while 854 students participated in this
course, some minor data loss occurred after removing outliers and
those who failed to complete the outcome measures. the final
sample consisted of 844 students. females made up 64.3% of this



105

vasile

yes, stable over time

shaffer

yeah, and it also mentioned it can't be because of drugs

art

also they have to have like unrealistic fantasies

nia

yeah and not normal in their culture

carl

no drugs or physical injury

vasile

begins in early adulthood or adolescence

shaffer

i think that covers them? haha

art

ok, so arrogance doesn't just define it, they have to have
most of these characteristics

art

yeah i think we got them

shaffer

is it most or is it like 6?

from the above excerpt, we can see several obvious things. first,
the lengths of the utterances varied from one single word to multiple sentences. this needs to be considered in text analysis because some methods work only for longer texts. for example,
coh-metrix usually works well for texts with more than 200
words. topic modeling also needs enough length to reliably infer
topic scores. second, the number of utterances each participant
gave were different. from how much and what a member said, we
can see each member played a different role in that chat. third,
the ordered sequence of the utterances forms a time series. understanding and visualizing the underlying discourse dynamics are
important for meaning making with this type of data.
the data set contained 15,670 utterances, pretest scores (the first
quiz) and post test scores (the second quiz) for 844 students,
grouped in 182 chat rooms. each chat room had 2 to 5 students,
4.73 by average. the average speech turns each student gave was
18.2 and the average speech turns in each room was 86.1.
the average pretest score was 36.01% correct and the average
post-test scores 45.73% correct. paired sample test shows that the
post-test is significantly higher (𝑡 = 14.13, 𝑁 = 844). we computed the learning gain of each student, using the formula
𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 =

𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 − 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒
1−𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒

.

for all students (𝑁 = 844), the average learning gain is 0.11,
59.5% had positive learning gains above 0.1. 16.5% had the same
scores and 23% had negative learning gains. not surprisingly,
students who had lower pretest scores had higher learning gains
because they had greater potential to learn. figure 1 shows the
average learning gain as function of pretest score.

this data set has been analyzed in multiple studies. cade et al. [3]
analyzed the cohesion of the chats and found that deep cohesion
of the chats predicts the students feeling of power and connectedness to the group. dowell et al. [7] found that some coh-metrix
measures predicts learning. coh-metrix measures describe common textual features that are not content specific. for example,
cohesion is about how text segments are semantically linked to
each other, which has nothing to do with what the text content is
about. in this study, we use topic modeling to provide content
dependent features and use epistemic network analysis to explore
how the topics were associated in the chats.

4. topic modeling
topic modeling has been widely used in text analysis to find what
topics are in a text and what proportion/amount of each topic is
contained. latent dirichlet allocation (lda) [2; 24] is one of the
most popular methods for topic modeling. lda uses a generative
process to find topic representations. lda starts from a large
document set 𝐷 = {𝑑1 , 𝑑2 , ⋯ , 𝑑𝑚 }. a word list 𝑊 =
{𝑤1 , 𝑤2 , ⋯ , 𝑤𝑛 } is then extracted from the document set. lda
assumes that the document set contains a certain number of topics,
say, k topics. each document has a probability distribution over
the k topics and each topic has a probability distribution over the
given list of words. when a document was composed, each word
that occurred in a document was assumed to be drawn based on
the document-topic probability and the topic-word probability.
for a given corpus (document set) and a given number of topics
k, lda can compute the topic assignment of each word in each
document.
for a given topic, the word probability distribution can be easily
computed from the number of times each word was assigned to
the given topic. the beauty of topic modeling is that the “top
words” (words with highest probabilities in a topic) usually give a
meaningful interpretation of a topic. the distributions are the
underlying representation of the topics. the top words are usually
used to show what topics are contained in the corpus.
by counting the number of words assigned to each topic, a topic
proportion score can be computed for each document on each
topic. the topic proportion scores then become a document feature that can be used in further analysis. however, the proportion
scores are based on the statistical topic assignment of words.
when documents are very short, such as most utterances in our
chat data, the topic proportion scores won’t be reliable. cai et al.
[4] argued that alternative ways to compute document topic scores
are possible.

figure 1. average learning gain as a function of pretest score.

although our chat data set contained 15,670 utterances, the utterances were short and the corpus is not large enough to build a
reliable topic model. to get a reliable model, we used a well
known corpus provided by tasa (touchstone applied science
associates). this corpus contained documents on seven known
categories, including business, health, home economics, industrial
arts, language arts, science and social studies. our content topic,
personality disorders, is obviously in the health category. of
course, not all topics in tasa are relevant to our study. therefore, after building up the model, we need to select relevant topics. we will cover that in the next sub-section.



106

there are a total of 37,651 documents in tasa corpus, each of
which is about 250 words long. before we ran lda, we filtered
out very high frequency words and very low frequency words.
high frequency words, such as “the”, “of”, “in”, etc., won’t contain much topic information. rare words won’t contribute to
meaningful statistics. 28,483 words (it might be better to say
“terms”) were left after filtering. a model with 300 topics was
constructed by lda.

4.2 topic score computation and topic selection
from the tasa topic model, we computed the word-topic probabilities based on the number of times a word was assigned to each
of the 300 topics. thus, each word is represented by a 300 dimensional probability distribution vector. for each chat in our chat
corpus, we simply summed up the word probability vectors for the
words appeared in each chat. that gave us 300 topic scores for
each chat. recall that, the chats were associated with a reading
material and two quizzes. while the students were free to talk
about anything, the content of the reading material and the quizzes
set up the main chat topics, that is, personality disorders.

figure 2. sorted topic scores for topic selection.
the first thing we needed to do then was to investigate whether or
not the “hot” topics from the computation made sense. to find
that out, we computed the sum of all topic scores over all chats.
the topics were sorted according the total topic score. the hottest
topic had a total score higher than 1300, much higher than the
second highest (less than 900). by examining the top words, this
topic is about “illness”, which is highly relevant to personality
disorders. six hot topics scored in the range from 600 to 900.
they are about “outdoors”, “biology”, “people/social”, “education” and “healthcare”. the top words are listed below.

“illness”, “biology”, “psychology” and “healthcare” are the topics
the learning materials involved. “education” topic is about the
education environment where the chat happened. “outdoor” and
“people/social” are off-task topics.
to get an idea about whether or not the topic scores were related
to the learning gain, we aggregated the scores by person and computed the correlation between the total topic score and the learning
gain for each topic. we were only interested in looking at the
students with larger potential to learn, so we removed the data
with pretest score greater than or equal to 0.5, leaving 624 students out of 844. the results (table 1) showed that all topics were
significantly correlated to learning gain. it doesn’t seem to be
great, because that seems to suggest that, whatever topic a student
talked about, more a student talked, larger gain the student obtained. the real reason is that in the aggregation, all topic scores
were summed up. therefore, all topic scores were influenced by
the chat length. so the correlation in table 2 basically showed the
chat length effect.

to remove the chat length effect, the simplest way is to divide all
scores by the number of words (terms) in each chat. however, in
this study, to be consistent with subsequent analysis, we normalized the topic scores to topic proportion scores by dividing each
topic score for each utterance by the sum of all seven topic scores
of the same utterance.
the results (table 3) showed that the topic “people/social” had a
significant negative correlation to learning gain. others were not
significant but were in the direction we would expect. “illness”,
“biology”, “psychology” and “healthcare” were positively correlated with gain scores, while “outdoors” and “people/social” topics were negatively correlated with gains scores. we observed
almost no correlation for the “education” topic. this seems to
indicate that the aggregated topic scores have limited power in
predicting learning. therefore, we used ena to examine the connections or association of these topics in the students discourse to

develop a predictive model of learning gains based on the use of
these topics.

5. epistemic network analysis
ena measures the connections between elements in data and
represents them in dynamic network models. ena creates these
network models in a metric space that enables the comparison of
networks in terms of (a) difference graph that highlights how the
weighted connections of one network differ from another; and (b)
statistics that summarize the weighted structure of network connections, enabling comparisons of many networks at once.
ena was originally developed to model cognitive networks involved in complex thinking. these cognitive networks represent
associations between knowledge, skills, habits of mind of individual learners or groups of learners. in this study, we used ena to
construct network models. for each individual student, we constructed an ena network using the selected seven topic scores for
each utterance the student contributed to the group.

5.1 process
while the process of creating ena models is described in more
detail elsewhere (e.g. [11; 17-19]), we will briefly describe how
ena models are created based on topic modeling. here we defined network nodes as the seven topics identified from the topic
model. we defined the connections between nodes, or edges, as
the strength of the co-occurrence of topics within a moving stanza
window (msw) of size 5 [19]. to model connections between
topics we used the products of the topic scores summed across all
chats in the msw. that is, for each topic, the topic scores are
summed across all 5 chats in the msw. then ena computed the
product of the summed topic loadings for each pair topics to
measure the strength of their co-occurrence. for example, if the
sum of the topics scores across five chats was 0.5 for “illness”, 0.3
for “psychology”, and 0.2 for “healthcare”, these scores would
result in three co-occurrences, “illness-psychology”, “illnesshealthcare”, and “psychology-healthcare”, with scores of 0.15,
0.1, and 0.06, respectively.
next ena created adjacency matrices for each student that quantified the co-occurrences of topics within the students’ discourse
in the context of their chat group. subsequently, the adjacency
matrices were then treated as vectors in a high dimensional space,
where each dimension corresponds to co-occurrence of a pair of
topics. the vectors were then normalized to unit vectors. notice
that the normalization removed the effect of chat length embedded
in the topic scores. a singular value decomposition (svd) was
then performed for dimensional reduction. ena then projected a
vector for each student into a low dimensional space that maximizes the variance explained in the data. finally, the nodes of the

networks, which in this case correspond to the seven selected
topics generated from tasa corpus, were placed in the low dimensional space. the topic nodes were placed using an optimization algorithm such that the overall distances between centroids
(centers of the mass of the networks) and the corresponding projected student locations was minimized. a critical feature of ena
is that these node placements are fixed, that is, the nodes of each
network are in the same place for all units in the analysis. this
fixing of the location of the nodes allows for meaningful comparisons between networks in terms of their connection patterns
which allow us to interpret the metric space. as a result, ena
produced two coordinated representations: (1) the location of each
student in a projected metric space, in which all units of analysis
included in the model were located, and (2) weighted network
graphs for each student, which explained why the student was
positioned where it was in the space.
ena also allows us to compare the mean network graphs and
mean position in ena space between different groups of students. in this study, we only considered the students with high
potential to learn, i.e., the 624 students with pretest score < 0.5
(50% correct). among these students, we compared the networks
of low learning gain students (gain<-0.1, 𝑁=194) with the networks of high learning gain students (gain>0.43, 𝑁=105). we
compared these groups using difference network graph, which
was formed by subtracting the edge weights of the mean discourse
network for the low gain group students from the mean discourse
network from the high gain group. this difference network graph
shows us which topic connections are stronger for each group. in
addition, we conducted a t-test to test the difference between
group means.

5.2 results
figure 3 shows mean discourse networks for students with low
gain scores (left, red), students with high gain scores (right, blue),
and a difference network graph (center) that shows how the discourse patterns of each group differs. students with low gains had
stronger connections between the “people/social” topic and all
other topics except for “illness”. more importantly, the connection that was the strongest for low gain students compared to high
gain students was between “people/social” and “outdoors”. students with high gain scores made stronger connections between
the topics of “illness”, “psychology”, “healthcare”, “biology”, and
“education”.

figure 4 shows centroids, or the centers of mass, of individual
students’ discourse networks and their means with low gain score
students in red and high gain score students in blue. the differences between these two groups were significant on the x dimensions (see table 4). this means that the differences we saw in
figure 2 and described above are statistically significant. in other
words, the high learning gain students’ discourse was more towards the right side of the ena space and the low learning gain
students’ discourse was more towards the left side. that indicates
that the discourse of students with high learning gains made more
connections between on-task topics (“illness”, “psychology”,
“healthcare”, “biology”, and “education”), while the discourse of



108

low gain students made more connections between off-task topics
(“people/social” and “outdoors”).

6. discussion
ena makes it possible to visualize the chat dynamics to help
researchers gain deeper understanding of what is going on in a
collaborative learning environment. differences in what topics
students connect in discourse can predict learning outcomes. previous use of ena has relied on human coded data or use of regular expressions to classify data. utilizing topic modeling can lead
to fully automated ena, making it more accessible to a wider
group of researchers and allows ena to be used with more and
larger data sets.
the fact that the epistemic network predicts learning validates
further application of ena. for example, the turn by turn chat
dynamics can be plotted as trajectories in the 2-d space, where the

topics are placed. investigating the trajectory patterns and their
relationship to learning or socio-affective components are interesting future research directions.
we used a general topic model in this study. many studies in the
literature used lda for topic modeling on relatively small corpora. this causes two problems. 1) lda topic models built upon
small corpora are not reliable, because lda requires large number documents with relatively large size for each document. inadequate corpus can result in misleading results. 2) using a topic
model that is not common would result in arbitrary interpretation.
for example, the representation of “illness” from different corpus
could be very different. therefore, it is hard to compare the claims
made to “illness” across different studies. using a reliable, common topic models will set up a common language for different
studies.

figure 3: mean discourse networks for students with low gain scores (left, red), students with high gain scores (right, blue), and a
difference network graph (center).
chat utterances are too short. the statistical inference algorithm
contains a high degree of randomness for short documents. as an
extreme example, an utterance with a single word, would result in
inferred topic proportion scores with “1” on one topic and “0” on
others. the problem is that, this “1” was assigned to a topic with
certain degree of uncertainty. that is, the topic this “1” was assigned to could be any topic. while aggregated analysis may not
be sensitive to such uncertainty, detailed utterance by utterance
analysis would suffer from it.
our method of computing topic scores is based on the topic probability distribution over each word. we treat the topic distribution
of each word as a vector. when computing the topic score, the
simple sum of all word vectors gives scores to all topics. as we
have pointed out, the summation algorithm will have a length
effect. therefore, when such topic scores are used, removing
length effects through normalization is necessary. in this article,
we did not use weighted sum as suggested in cai et al. [4]. comparing the effect of different weighting is beyond the scope of this
paper.

topic scores for documents are usually inferred from topic models. while for longer documents, the topic scores can be used in
many applications (e.g., text clustering [1]), the inferred topic
proportion scores won’t be useful for analyzing chats if we need
to treat each utterance as a unit of analysis. it is not useful because

when a general topic model is used, selecting topics relevant to
the specific analysis becomes important. our approach was to
look at the total scores of utterances and find the “hot” topics by
sorting the total topic scores. in our study, we had a quickly decreasing curve that helped us to select topics. we believe this
would be the case for most studies using a model containing far
more topics than the topics contained in the target data.

although our study started with topic modeling to capture the
“what” in the chats, the association networks constructed in the
epistemic network analysis actually turned the “what” into a
“how”: how the topics in the chats associated with each other.
this is conceptually similar to the cohesion features dowell [7]
and cade [3] used.
topic modeling emphasizes content words. when a topic model is
built, stop words are usually removed. an interesting question is,
what if we do the opposite: keep stop words and remove content
words? pennebaker (e.g., [13]) laid foundational work in this direction. the liwc tool pennebaker and his colleagues created
provides over a hundred text measures by counting non-content
words. liwc measures could provide different features to epistemic network analysis and reveal different aspects of the chat
dynamics.

abstract
in this study, we applied decision trees (dt) to extract
a compact set of pedagogical decision-making rules from
an original full set of 3,702 reinforcement learning (rl)induced rules, referred to as the dt-rl rules and full-rl
rules respectively. we then evaluated the effectiveness of
the two rule sets against a baseline random condition in
which the tutor made random yet reasonable decisions. we
explored two types of trees (weighted and unweighted) as
well as two pruning strategies (pre- and post-pruning). we
found that post-pruned weighted trees produced the best results with 529 dt-rl rules. the empirical evaluation was
conducted in a classroom study using an existing intelligent
tutoring system (its) named pyrenees. 153 students were
randomly assigned to three conditions. the procedure was
the same for all students with domain content and required
steps strictly controlled. the only substantive differences
between the three conditions were the policy: (full-rl vs.
dt-rl vs. random). our result showed that as expected
the machine induced policies (full-rl and dt-rl) are significantly more effective than the random policy; more importantly, no significant difference was found between the
full-rl and dt-rl policies though the number of dt-rl
rules is less than 15% of the number of the full-rl rules
and the former group also took significantly less time than
the latter.

1.

introduction

intelligent tutoring systems (itss) are interactive e-learning
environments that support students’ learning by providing
instruction, scaffolded practice, and on-demand help. the
system’s behaviors can be viewed as a sequential decisionmaking process where at each step the system chooses an
appropriate action from a set of options. pedagogical strategies are the policies used to decide what action to take next
in the face of alternatives. each system decision will affect
the user’s subsequent actions and performance. its impact
on outcomes cannot always be immediately observed and the
effectiveness of each decision depends upon the effectiveness

of subsequent actions. ideally, an effective learning environment will adapt its decisions to users’ specific needs [1, 11].
however, there is no existing well-established theory on how
to make these system decisions effectively. generally speaking, prior research on pedagogical policies can be divided
into two general categories: top-down or theory-driven, and
bottom-up or data-driven.
in theory-driven approaches, itss employ hand-coded pedagogical rules that seek to implement existing cognitive or
learning theories [1, 10, 17]. while existing learning literature gives helpful guidance on the design of pedagogical
rules, such guidance is often too general to implement as
effective immediate decisions. for example, the aptitudetreatment interaction (ati) theory states that instructors
should match their interventions to the aptitude of the learner
[5]. while the principle behind this theory is understandable, it is not clear how to implement that rule for each
decision. how do we represent learner’s aptitude for each
equation, how exact should be the system’s adaptation, and
so on.
data-driven approaches, on the other hand, derive pedagogical policies directly from prior data. here the policies
specify the pedagogical decisions at a detailed level. reinforcement learning (rl), which we use here, is one popular
approach that is able to derive pedagogical policies directly
from student-system interaction logs. these policies are defined as a set of state-action mapping rules, which give the
best decision to take in each state. the states are typically
represented as sets of features and the actions are pedagogical actions such as presenting a worked example (we) or
requiring the student to solve problems (ps). when the system presents a worked example, the students will be given a
detailed example showing a complete expert solution for the
problem or the best step to take given their current solution
state. in problem solving, by contrast, students are tasked
with solving a problem using the its or with completing an
individual problem-solving step.
for this project, our original complete rl-induced policy involves the following seven features representing the students’
learning process from different perspectives1 .

112

1. [nwesinceps] (0 → 0; (0, 1] → 1; (1, +∞) → 2):
the number of worked example (we) steps received
since the last problem solving (ps) step.
2. [timeinsession] ([0, 2290] → 0; (2290, 4775] → 1;
(4775, 7939] → 2; (7939, +∞) → 3): the total time
spent in the current session.
3. [avgtimeonstepps] ([0, 29.01] → 0; (29.01,
48.71] → 1; (48.71, +∞) → 2): the average amount of
time spent on each ps step.
4. [avgtimeonstepsessionps] ([0, 23.51] → 0;
(23.51, 36.56] → 1; (36.56, 55] → 2; (55, +∞) → 3):
the average amount of time spent on each ps step in
the current session.
5. [nstepsincelastwrongkc] ([0, 1] → 0; (1, 7]
→ 1; (7, 25] → 2; (25, +∞) → 3): the number of steps
received since the last wrong ps step on the current
knowledge component (kc).
6. [nwestepsincelastwrong] ([0, 1] → 0; (1, 4]
→ 1; (4, 10] → 2; (10, +∞) → 3): the number of we
steps since the last wrong ps step.
7. [ncorrectpsstepsincelastwrongkcsession]
(0 → 0; (0, 3] → 1; (3, 10] → 2; (10, +∞) → 3): the
number of correct ps steps since the last wrong ps
step on the current kc in the current session.
with this feature set, a state can be represented as a 7dimensional vector where each element denotes a discretized
feature value. then, the rules can then be represented as:
(0:0:0:0:0:0:0) -> ps
(0:0:0:0:0:0:1) -> ps
(0:0:0:0:0:1:0) -> ps
(0:0:0:0:0:1:1) -> we
in this study we discretized the features into three-four values producing a seven-feature state. this results in a state
space of 32 ∗ 45 = 9216, that is 9216 rules in one rl-induced
policy. while these types of polices can specify the exact
action to take in each case, they are usually too narrow to
be aligned to existing learning theories. each of the rules
covers only a very specific case and the relationship between
rules is unknown. thus it is impossible to explain the power
of those rules from the perspective of learning theory. the
opacity of those induced rules not only hinders us in improving data-driven methodologies when they go wrong, it also
prevents us from advancing learning science research more
generally. moreover, it is possible that some of the decisions
are environment-specific and may not generalize to other
contexts. this in turn prevents translating these induced
policies to environments other than the one from which they
are induced. therefore, a general method is needed to shed
some light on the extracted detailed data-driven policies.
decision tree (dt) induction is a robust data mining approach which can be used to extract a compact set of rules
from a set of specific examples. it builds a tree-like hierarchical decision-making pattern which represents the knowledge it learned. each path from root to leaf represents a
single rule which may be dealt with separately. prior studies have shown that dts can match training examples in
most cases, even with relatively small trees. davidson et

al., for example, built a dt for predicting the extinction
risk of mammals [6]. each of the species was described by
11 ecological features (e.g body mass, geographic range and
population density) and were labeled with their extinction
risk (threatened vs. non-threatened). their tree contained
20 general rules which covered 4500 training examples, with
a decision accuracy over 80%. additionally, reinchard et al.
built a dt for predicting the invasiveness of woody plants
[13]. the resulting dt encoded 15 rules from 235 examples,
with a decision accuracy over 76%. therefore, in our study,
we will apply dt to extract general pedagogical decisionmaking rules from the detailed rl-induced policies.
in short, our primary research question is: is dt an effective methodology for extracting more general pedagogical
rules from the detailed rl-induced pedagogical rules? in order to investigate this question, we will build dts using the
rules in a rl-induced policy as training examples and empirically evaluate the effectiveness of the extracted set of dt
rules by comparing it to the full set of rl-induced rules in a
classroom study. the state features in the rl-induced policies are the input features for the dt and the pedagogical
actions are the output labels. in our empirical evaluation,
we separate the pedagogical decisions from the instructional
content, strictly controlling the content so that it is equivalent for all participants by 1) using an its which provides
equal support for all learners; and 2) focusing on tutorial
decisions that cover the same domain content, in this case
we versus ps.

2. background
2.1 applying rl to itss
beck et al. applied rl to induce pedagogical policies that
would minimize the time students take to complete problems on animalwatch, an its for grade school arithmetic
[2]. they trained the model with simulated students. the
low cost of generated data allowed them to apply a modelfree rl method, temporal difference learning. during the
test phase, the induced policies were added to animalwatch
and the new system was empirically compared with the original system. their results showed that the policy group
spent significantly less time per problem than their no-policy
peers. note that their primary goal was to reduce the amount
of time per problem, however faster problem-solving does
not always result in better learning performance. nonetheless, their results showed that rl can be successfully applied
to induce pedagogical policies for itss.
iglesias et al., on the other hand, focused on applying rl to
improve the effectiveness of an intelligent educational system that teaches students database design [8, 9]. they
applied another model-free rl algorithm, q-learning to induce policies that provide students with direct navigation
support through the system’s content. they used simulated
students to induce the policy and empirically evaluated its
effectiveness on real students. their results showed that
while the policy led to more effective system usage behaviors from students, the policy students did not outperform
the no-policy peers in terms of learning outcomes.
shen investigated the impact of both immediate and delayed reward functions on rl-induced policies and empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the induced policies within



113

an intelligent tutoring system called deep thought [15].
the induced pedagogical policies are used to decide whether
the next task should be we or ps. they found that some
learners benefited significantly more from effective pedagogical policies than others.
finally, chi et al. applied model-based rl to induce pedagogical policies to improve the effectiveness of an intelligent
natural language tutoring system for college-level physics
called cordillera [4]. the authors collected an exploratory
corpus by training human students on an its that makes
random decisions and then applied rl to induce pedagogical policies from the corpus. they showed that the induced
policies were significantly more effective than the prior ones.
in short, prior studies have shown that rl-induced pedagogical policies can improve students’ learning or reduce
training time. however, all of these studies focused on the
effectiveness of the rl-induced policies. none of them considered extracting more general rules from the induced policies.

2.2

extracting general rules

in addition to the work of davidson et al. [6] and reinchard
et al. [13], dts have been used for other tasks. vayssiers
et al., for example, applied classification and regression
trees to predict the presence of 3 species of oak in california [18]. their training examples were vegetation type map
records for 2085 unique locations. each record consisted of
25 climatic and geographic features as well as 3 labels showing the presence of the species (quercus agrifolia, quercus
douglasii and quercus lobata). one dt was induced for
each type. the dts were tested on another dataset which
contains the same type of records for 2016 locations. for
quercus agrifolia, the induced tree had 10 leaf nodes and
94.9% of its predictions are correct for the locations that
have the presence of this oak (sensitivity) while 86.7% of
its predictions are correct for cases without the oak (specificity). for quercus douglasii, the induced tree had 22 leaf
nodes and a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 79.9%
respectively. for quercus lobata, the tree had 6 leaves but
reached a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 73.3%.
thus, prior studies have shown that dt can effectively extract a small set of general decision-making rules from a
large set of specific examples. however, all the examples
used by these studies were observations of existing phenomena. so far as we know, this work is the only relevant research on the application of dt to extract a compact set
of decision-making rules directly from full rl-induced rules
and empirically evaluated the two sets of the rules.

2.3

applying dt to rl

prior research on incorporating dt with rl has largely
focused on seeking a better representation of state space
or policy for rl. boutilier et al [3]. proposed representational and computational techniques for markov decision
processes (mdps) to reduce the size of the state space.
they used dynamic bayesian networks and dts to represent stochastic actions as well as dts to represent rewards.
based upon this representation, they then developed algorithms to find conditional optimal policies. their method
was empirically evaluated on several planning problems and

they showed significant savings in both time and space for
some types of problems. gupta et al. proposed the policy
tree algorithm for rl. this algorithm is designed to directly
induce a functional representation of the conditional optimal
policies as a dt. they evaluated it on a variety of domains
and showed that it was able to make splits properly [7].
in short, prior researchers have shown that properly combining dt with rl can result in a large amount of savings
in time and space for finding good policies. however, none
of these studies directly applied dt on rl-induced policies.

3.

induce full set of rl-policy

previously, researchers have typically used the markov decision process (mdp) [16] framework to model user-system
interactions. the central idea behind this approach is to
transform the problem of inducing effective pedagogical policies on what action the agent should take to the problem of
computing an optimal policy for an mdp.

3.1 markov decision process
an mdp is a mathematical framework for representing an
rl task. it is defined by: a tuple hs , a, t , ri. where s =
{s1 , s2 , ..., sn } denotes the state space; a = {a1 , a2 , ..., am }
represents a set of agent’s possible actions; and t : s × a ×
s → [0, 1] is a transition probability table, where each element is tsai sj = p(sj |si , a). this in turn indicates the
probability of transiting from state si to state sj by taking an action a while r : s × a × s → r assigns rewards
to state transitions given actions. the policy is defined as
π : s → a, mapping state s into action a with the goal of
maximizing the expected reward.
after defining an mdp, we can transfer the student-system
interaction dialog into the trajectory which can then be represented as follows:
a ,r

a ,r

a ,r

1
2
3
s1 −−1−−→
s2 −−2−−→
s3 −−3−−→
... → sn

a ,r

i
where si −−i−−→
si+1 means that the tutor executed action
ai and received reward ri in state si , and then transferred
to the next state si+1 . in general, the reward can be divided
into two categories, immediate and delayed, where immediate rewards are received during the state transition, and
delayed are available after reaching to goal state.

3.2 training datasets
our training dataset was collected from three exploratory
studies in which students were trained on an its which made
random yet reasonable pedagogical decisions. the studies
were given as homework assignments during csc226: discrete mathematics, a core cs course offered at ncsu during the fall 2014, spring 2015 and fall 2015 semesters. the
dataset contains a total of 149 students’ interaction logs.
all students used the same its, followed the same general
procedure, studied the same training materials, and worked
through the same training problems. in order to model the
students’ learning process, we extracted a total of 142 state
feature variables, which can be grouped into five categories:
1. autonomy (am): the amount of work done by the student: such as the number of problems solved so far pscount
or the number of hints requested hintcount.



114

2. temporal situation (ts): the time related information about the work process: such as the average time taken
per problem avgtime, or the total time spent solving a problem totalpstime.
3. problem solving (ps): information about the current
problem solving context, such as the difficulty of the current
problem probdiff, or whether the student changes the difficulty level newlevel.
4. performance (pm): information about the student’s
performance during problem solving: such as the number of
right application of rules rightapp.
5. student action (sa): the statistical measurement of
student’s behavior: such as the number of non-empty-click
actions that students take actioncount, or the number of
clicks for derivation appcount.

based methods and an ensemble method and capped the
maximum number of state feature size to be eight. more
details of our feature selection methods are described in [14].
the final resulting rl policy involves seven state features
and 3706 rules.

4.1 unweighted vs. weighted tree

inducing rl policies

in order to apply rl to induce pedagogical policies, we
first defined the pedagogical decision-making problem as an
mdp. the state representation includes all of the relevant
features available at the beginning of each step. the actions are we and ps at the step level. the transition tables were calculated on our training dataset, and our reward
function includes two types of reward: delayed and immediate. our most important reward is based on normalized
), which measures the
learning gain (nlg) ( posttest−pretest
1−pretest
students’ learning gains irrespective of their incoming competence. this reward was given as a delayed reward as nlg
scores can only be calculated after students finish the entire
training process. however, shen et al. [15] showed that giving immediate rewards can lead to the production of more
effective policies when compared to delayed rewards. this
is known as the credit-assignment problem. the more that
we delay success measures from a series of sequential decisions, the more difficult it becomes to identify which of the
decision(s) in the sequence are responsible for our final success or failure. therefore, for the purposes of this study we
also assigned immediate rewards based upon the students’
performance during training on the system.
the value iteration algorithm was applied to find the optimal
policy. this algorithm operates by finding the optimal value
for each state v ∗ (s). the optimal value for a given state is
the expected discounted reward that the agent will gain if
it starts in s and follows the optimal policy to the goal.
generally speaking, v ∗ (s) can be obtained by the optimal
value function for each state-action pair q∗ (s, a) which is
defined as the expected discounted reward the agent will
gain if it takes an action a in a state s and follows the optimal
policy to the end. the optimal state value v ∗ (s) and value
function q∗ (s, a) can be obtained by iteratively updating
v (s) and q(s, a) via equations 1 and 2 until they converge:
x
q(s, a) := r(s, a) + γ
p(sj |si , a)v (s0 )
(1)
v (s)

:=

s0 ∈s

max q(s, a)
a

(2)

here, p(sj |si , a) is the estimated transition model t , r(s, a)
is the estimated reward model and 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 is a discount
factor.
to induce effective pedagogical policies, we combined rl
with various feature selections including 10 types of correlation-

4.

extracting compact dt-rl sets

in order to extract a more compact set of decision-making
rules from the full set of rl-induced rules, we implemented
the id3 algorithm to build dts [12]. each rule in the final
rl-induced policy was used as a training example. two
types of decision trees were built: unweighted and weighted,
as well as two types of pruning strategies were implemented:
pre- and post-pruning. next, we will discuss each of them
in turn.

the decision to give a we vs. ps may impact students’
learning differently in different situations. we therefore built
two types of decision trees: unweighted and weighted. unweighted trees treated each decision equally while weighted
trees take account of the relative importance of each pedagogical rule. when applying the value iteration algorithm
to induce the optimal policy, we generate the optimal value
function q∗ (s, a), which gives the expected discounted reward each agent will gain if it takes an action a in a state s
and follows the optimal policy to the end. for a given state
s, a large difference between the values of q(s, “p s”) and
q(s, “w e”) indicates that it is more important for the its
to follow the optimal decision in the state s. we therefore
used the absolute difference between the q values for each
state s to weight each rl pedagogical rule.
the id3 algorithm builds a tree recursively from root to
leaves. on each iteration of the construction process the
algorithm will check the state of the dataset for the current
branch. it will then select a test feature for the current
node based upon the weighted information gain. the current
node will then be expanded by adding branches to it, each
of which represents a possible value for the selected feature.
the data will be partitioned over the branches according to
the value of the test feature. the selected feature cannot
be used again by its children. weighted information gain is
defined by the difference between the weighted entropy of the
examples before it is selected and after they are separated
by feature value. the weighted entropy of a node can be
calculated by equation 3

pre-pruning and post-pruning

to control the size of rules induced by dt, we examined
two types of pruning strategy: pre- and post-pruning. the
pre-pruning is conducted during the process of building the
tree and it used the information gain to determine whether
to expand or to terminate. only nodes with an information
gain greater than a threshold times its depth: ig(f, g) ≥
θ × dg will be expanded and others will be made as a leaf.
θ is a fixed threshold and dg is the depth of node g.
post-pruning is conducted after the whole decision tree is
built and it used the error rate as the pruning measure. the
error
rate before a node is expanded is defined as: eg =
p
i∈i wi
. i is the set of the decisions incorrectly classified
|g|
by node g and |g| is the total number of examples in the
node g. the
p error
p rate after a node is expanded is defined
wi
as: ec = c∈c |g|j∈ic . c is the set of children nodes
of g after it is expanded and ic is the set of the decisions
incorrectly classified by the node c. in post-pruning, if the
difference of a node’s error rate from before to after split is
less than a threshold, the node will be pruned by removing
all of its branches to make it a leaf node.

4.3

the compact set of dt-rl rules

in order to induce a compact set of dt-rl rules, we applied the dts to the full set of 3706 rl-induced rules. the
induced unweighted and weighted dts without pruning has
2527 and 2456 rules (leaf nodes) respectively. thus, without pruning, dts are already able to extract a smaller set
of rules: it reduced the total number of rules by over 1000.
figure 1 shows the relationship between the number of leaf
nodes (x-axis) and the inverted weighted accuracy (y-axis).
weighted accuracy(w a) is the weighted percentage of decisions correctlypmade, which can be calculated by the equation: w a =

di ∈t

p

di

wi

wi

. t is the set of correct predictions

made by a dt and wi is the weight of decision i. the inverted weighted accuracy (iw a) is iw a = w a−10 , the
lower the better. since our goal is to find a good balance
point between the iwa and the number of leaf nodes, we
applied a widely used strategy called the elbow method,
to select the best tree. as we can see in the figure, the
elbows for the two unweighted tree approaches are around
800 and 1700 rules (x-axis) for the pre and post pruning
respectively while the elbows for the two weighted tree approaches are around 250 and 500 for the pre and post pruning respectively. so it seems that weighted tree can extract
more compact set of rules than the unweighted trees. while
the weighted pre-pruning approach has around 250 rules,
its iwa is much higher than the weighted post-pruning approach. therefore, we chose the weighted tree with postpruning strategy which has the an elbow at about 500 leaf
nodes and reasonable iwa.
to further justify our dt choice, table 1 shows the relationship between the pruning thresholds, w a and the number

figure 1: leaf nodes - accuracy
of leaf nodes for the weighted tree with post-pruning. table 1 shows that the tree with the closest number of leaves
to 500 is the 529 one. it can be obtained by apply a pruning
threshold of 0.8 and the result tree has a weighted accuracy
of 0.76. the rules in the resulted tree will be the rules used
in the dt-rl condition.
in short, we applied dt on rl-induced pedagogical policies
to extract a more compact set of decision-making rules. the
effectiveness of the original full set and the compact set of
policies were empirically compared against a baseline policy
which makes random yet reasonable decisions: ps vs. we.
thus, we have three conditions:
1. full-rl: the full set of 3706 rl-induced rules.
2. dt-rl: the compact set of 529 dt-induced rl rules.
3. random: the random yet reasonable policy.

empirical experiment

participants: this study was conducted in the undergraduate discrete mathematics course at the department
of computer science at nc state university in the fall of
2016. 153 students participated in this study, which was
given as their final homework assignment.
conditions: students in the study were assigned to three
conditions via balanced random assignment based upon their
course section and performance on the class mid-term exam.
since the primary goal of this work is to examine the effectiveness of the two rl based policies, we assigned more
students to the full-rl and dt-rl conditions than in the
random condition. the final group sizes were: n = 61 (fullrl), n = 51 (dt-rl), and n = 41 (random).
due to preparations for exams and length of the experiment,
126 students completed the experiment. 5 students were
excluded from the subsequent analysis due to perfect pretest
scores, working in group or gaming the system during the
training. the remaining 121 students were distributed as
follows: n = 45 for full-rl; n = 41 for rl-dt; n = 35
for random. we performed a χ2 test of the relationship
between students’ condition and their rate of completion
and found no significant difference among the conditions:
χ2 (2) = 0.955, p = 0.620.
probability tutor: pyrenees is a web-based its for probability. it covers 10 major principles of probability, such
as the complement theorem and bayes’ rule. pyrenees

provides step-by-step instruction and immediate feedback.
pyrenees can also provide on-demand hints prompting the
student with what they should do next. as with other systems, help in pyrenees is provided via a sequence of increasingly specific hints. the last hint in the sequence, the
bottom-out hint, tells the student exactly what to do. for
the purposes of this study we incorporated three distinct
pedagogical decision modes into pyrenees to match the three
conditions.
procedure: in this experiment, students were required to
complete 4 phases: 1) pre-training, 2) pre-test, 3) training on
pyrenees, and 4) post-test. during the pre-training phase,
all students studied the domain principles through a probability textbook, reviewed some examples, and solved certain
training problems. the students then took a pre-test which
contained 14 problems. the textbook was not available at
this phase and students were not given feedback on their answers, nor were they allowed to go back to earlier questions.
this was also true of the post-test.
during phase 3, students in all three conditions received
the same 12 rather complicated problems in the same order
on pyrenees. each main domain principle was applied at
least twice. the minimal number of steps needed to solve
each training problem ranged from 20 to 50. these steps
included defining variables, applying principles, and solving equations. the number of domain principles required to
solve each problem ranged from 3 to 11. all of the students
could access the corresponding pre-training textbook during this phase. each step in the problems could have been
provided as either a we or ps based upon the condition
policy. finally, all of the students completed a post-test
with 20 problems. 14 of the problems were isomorphic to
the pre-test given in phase 2. the remaining six were nonisomorphic complicated problems.
grading criteria: the test problems required students to
derive an answer by writing and solving one or more equations. we used three scoring rubrics: binary, partial credit,
and one-point-per-principle. under the binary rubric, a solution was worth 1 point if it was completely correct or 0
if not. under the partial credit rubric, each problem score
was defined by the proportion of correct principle applications evident in the solution. a student who correctly applied 4 of 5 possible principles would get a score of 0.8. the
one-point-per-principle rubric in turn gave a point for each
correct principle application. all of the tests were graded in
a double-blind manner by a single experienced grader. the
results presented below are based upon the partial-credit
rubric but the same results hold for the other two. for
comparison purposes, all test scores were normalized to the
range of [0,1].

empirical results

since both the full-rl and dt-rl policies are based on an
rl-induced policy, we combined the two conditions together
as the induced group to evaluate the effectiveness the rlinduced policy. the evaluation was conducted by comparing
the induced group with the baseline random condition on
learning performance and training time. moreover, in order to further discover to what extent the compact policy
retained the power of the full policy, we compared the fullrl and dt-rl conditions on the same measures. next, we
will discuss each of the comparisons in turn.

6.1 induced vs. random
we measured students’ incoming competence via the pretest scores collected before training took place. table 2
shows a comparison between the induced group and the
random group in terms of learning performance. the parenthesized values following the group names in row 1 denote
the number of students in each group. the second row in this
table shows the pre-test scores. the last column shows the
pairwise t-test results. pairwise t-tests on students’ pre-test
scores show that there is no significant difference between
the two groups: t(119) = −0.346, p = 0.730, d = 0.069.
thus, despite attrition, the two groups remained balanced
in terms of incoming competence. next, we will compare the
two groups in terms of learning performance in the post-test
and training time.
rows 2 - 4 in table 2 show a comparison of the pre-test, isomorphic post-test (14 isomorphic questions), and adjusted
post-test scores between the two groups along with the mean
and sd for each. in order to examine the students’ improvement through training on pyrenees, we compared their
scores on the pre-test and isomorphic post-test questions.
a repeated measures analysis using test type (pre-test and
isomorphic post-test) as factors and test score as the dependent measure showed a main effect for test type: f (1, 119) =
98.75, p < 0.0001. further comparisons on group by group
basis showed that on the isomorphic questions, both groups
scored significantly higher in the post-test than in the pretest: f (1, 85) = 81.30, p < 0.0001 for induced and f (1, 34) =
18.30, p = 0.0001 for random respectively. this suggests
that the basic practice and problems, domain exposure, and
interactivity of our its might help students to learn even
when pedagogical decisions are made randomly.
in order to investigate the effectiveness of the induced policies, we compared students’ overall learning performance,
which was evaluated by their adjusted post-test scores, between the two groups. a one-way ancova analysis was
conducted on their overall post-test scores (20 questions),
using the pretest scores as a covariate to factor out the influence of their incoming competence. the result shows a
significant main effect: f (1, 118) = 4.628, p = 0.033. that
is, the induced group significantly outperformed the random group on adjusted post-test scores, which is shown in

the induced policies are significantly more effective than the
random policy.
the fifth row in table 2 shows the average amount of total
training time (in minutes) students spent on our its for each
group. pairwise t-test showed no significant difference in
training time between the two groups: t(119) = −0.815, p =
0.417, d = 0.163. the results suggest that when compared
to the random policy, the induced policies generally do not
have a significant different impact on students’ training time.
the last three rows in table 2 show the number of we
and ps steps given as well as the percentage of we steps
received by the induced and the random group. pairwise
t-tests showed that there is no significant difference between
the two groups on these three measures.

6.2

full-rl vs. dt-rl

we then performed the same comparison between the fullrl and dt-rl conditions in order to examine the effectiveness of the dt-extracted compact policy. the second row
in table 3 shows the pre-test scores for each condition. a
pairwise t-test on the scores shows no significant difference
between the two conditions: t(84) = −0.168, p = 0.867,
d = 0.036. thus the two conditions were balanced in terms
of incoming competence.
the pre-test, isomorphic post-test and adjusted post-test
scores are shown in rows 2 - 4 of table 3. a repeated measures analysis using test type (pre-test and isomorphic posttest) as factors and test score as dependent measure showed
a main effect for test type: f (1, 85) = 81.30, p < 0.0001.
further comparisons on group by group basis showed that
both conditions scored significantly higher in isomorphic
post-test than in pre-test: f (1, 44) = 42.16, p < 0.0001
for full-rl and f (1, 40) = 39.16, p < 0.0001 for dt-rl.
these results suggest that the students can effectively learn
from pyrenees with the full and compact policies.
in order to discover to what degree the compact policy retained the effectiveness of the full policy, we compared the
post-test scores between the two conditions. the results
of a pairwise t-test showed no significant different between
them on isomorphic post-test: t(84) = 0.505, p = 0.615,
d = 0.109. we also conducted an ancova analysis on the
overall post-test scores using the pretest scores as a covariate and still found no significant different between the two
conditions: f (1, 83) = 0.348, p = 0.557. in short, while on
post-test scores, the dt-rl condition scored slightly lower
than the full-rl condition, the difference is not significant.

the fifth row of table 3 shows the average amount of time
students spent on training. as the row shows, the fullrl condition spent significantly more time than the dt-rl
condition: t(84) = 3.829, p = 0.0002, d = 0.827. thus
the full-rl and dt-rl policies have significant different
impact upon the students’ training time.
the last three rows of table 3 show the number of we
and ps steps given and the percentage of we steps received by the full-rl and the dt-rl condition. pairwise t-tests showed that comparing to the dt-rl condition, the full-rl condition received significantly fewer we
steps: t(84) = −4.952, p < 0.0001, d = 1.069; received a
lower percentage of we steps: t(84) = −4.955, p < 0.0001,
d = 1.070; and completed more ps steps: t(84) = 4.999,
p < 0.0001, d = 1.079. these results suggest that the pedagogical decisions made by the compact and full policies are
substantively different.

discussion

in this study, we applied dt to extract a compact set of
pedagogical rules from the full set of rl-induced rules and
empirically evaluated the effectiveness of two sets of rules in
a classroom study. our goal was to shed some light on the
rl-induced policies and we think this is only the first step
towards narrowing the gap and building a bridge between
machine-induced pedagogical policies and learning theories.
in order to find the best dt, we explored two types of tree:
unweighted and weighted; and for each of them, we conducted two types of pruning strategy: pre- and post-pruning.
after comparing the performance among them, we selected
the weighted tree with the post-pruning strategy to perform
the extraction of general decision-making rules. the rlinduced policy contains 3706 specific rules, and the compact
dt-rl consisted of 529 rules with a weighted decision accuracy of 76%.
in our empirical experiment, we were able to strictly control
the domain content and thus to isolate the impact of pedagogy from content. based on this isolation, we compared
students’ performance with the full-rl policy, the dt-rl
policy and the baseline random policy. our results showed
that students in all three conditions learned significantly after training on pyrenees, this suggests that the basic training
of the its is effective, even when the pedagogical decisions
are made randomly. to evaluate the effectiveness of the two
machine induced policies (full-rl policy and dt-rl policy), we combined the full-rl and dt-rl condition as the
induced group and compared its learning performance with
the random group. our results showed that the induced

group significantly outperform the random group. these
results suggest that the machine induced policies are indeed
more effective than the random policy.
finally, in order to examine to what extent the compact dtrl policy retained the power of the full rl-induced policy,
we compared the learning performance of the full-rl and
the dt-rl conditions. our results suggest that while some
of the power was lost in the general rules extraction, the relative performance difference between the full-rl and the
dt-rl condition is not significant. in addition, our results
on the pedagogical decisions made in training revealed that
the compact dt-rl policy selected significant more we
than the full-rl policy. this suggests that the two sets
of policies indeed made materially different decisions. however, since the weighted dt took account of the importance
of each rule, the dt-rl policy aims to retain maximal decision effectiveness from the full-rl policy while the size of
the former is less than 15% of the size of the full-rl rules.
in the future, we will apply existing learning theories to the
decision-making process generated by decision tree to find
a theoretical basis for the dt-induced general pedagogical
decision-making rules.
